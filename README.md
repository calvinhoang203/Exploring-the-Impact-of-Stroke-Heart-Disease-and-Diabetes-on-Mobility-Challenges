# Exploring the Impact of Stroke, Heart Disease, and Diabetes on Mobility Challenges

## Project Overview
This project uses data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2015 dataset to analyze and predict heart disease indicators. The dataset includes various health-related metrics such as BMI, smoking habits, physical activity, and healthcare access, making it a comprehensive resource for understanding the factors contributing to heart disease.

The analysis aims to provide actionable insights and predictive models to identify individuals at risk for heart disease, enabling early intervention and better healthcare strategies.

## Inspiration
The inspiration for this project stems from the alarming prevalence of heart disease worldwide, which remains a leading cause of death. By leveraging data analytics and machine learning techniques, we hope to identify key factors influencing heart disease and develop predictive tools for early detection. This work was motivated by the need to reduce the human and economic burden of heart disease through better insights and data-driven decision-making.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project is the **Heart Disease Health Indicators** from the 2015 BRFSS survey. It includes:
- **22 Columns** representing health metrics, demographics, and lifestyle factors.
- **Key features** like BMI, physical activity, smoking habits, and mental health days.
- The target variable is `HeartDiseaseorAttack`, which indicates whether an individual has had a heart disease or heart attack.

## Analysis Details

### Objectives
1. Identify the strongest predictors of heart disease from the dataset.
2. Build and evaluate machine learning models for heart disease risk prediction.
3. Provide recommendations based on the findings to improve public health policies.

### Methods
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding the dataset structure, visualizing patterns, and identifying correlations.
- **Feature Engineering:** Selecting and preparing the most relevant features for prediction.
- **Model Building:** Using machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict the target variable.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Assessing model performance with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
- **Predictors Identified:** Variables like `HighBP`, `HighChol`, and `PhysActivity` emerged as significant factors.
- **Model Performance:** The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of X% with balanced precision and recall (to be updated after analysis is complete).
- **Health Insights:** Individuals with regular physical activity and healthy BMI had a lower risk of heart disease.

## Challenges and Learnings

### Challenges
- Handling missing or inconsistent data in a large dataset.
- Balancing the dataset for better model performance given the imbalance in heart disease cases.

### Learnings
Through this project, we gained deeper insights into how lifestyle factors and demographics affect heart disease risk. We also strengthened our skills in data preprocessing and predictive modeling.
